# Paper:

1. Predictive models in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease through voice analysis by Tomás Freitas Gonçalves (UPorto)
   #Research Questions:
   
     1) Can automatically learned features — different from traditional ones such as Jitter, Shimmer, HNR, or MFCCs — extracted using deep neural networks (e.g., Wav2Vec, YAMNet,               Whisper, etc.) and used in machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) lead to better predictive performance?
     2) Are deep learning models practically usable in clinical and medical settings?

   #Strategy:

     1) Deep feature extraction + classical classifier

   #Proposals for Implementation:
   
     1) Use both deep neural networks (DNNs) and pre-trained models (such as Wav2Vec, etc.) directly for the classification of Parkinson’s disease from raw audio data.
